Purpose: The purpose of this website is to help users easily generate giphs from Giphy by typing in the kinds of giphs they want on the search bar to the left. The website will then quickly generate a giph related to whatever they searched for and users can then repeat that search over and over again to generate more giphs related to that search term or they can change it to something else. All giphs generated will remain on the page unless the page is refreshed.

On the right side of the website there is the Generate Joke Button. With this button, the website will generate a random joke and users can continue to click the button to generate more jokes. Once again, the jokes will remain on the right side of the screen and will only be erased once the page is refreshed.


Current author: Maintenance and further contributions are made by Christopher Gonzalez, Vannak Suos, Mark Fomin, and Nathan Lane.
